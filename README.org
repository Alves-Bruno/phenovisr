#+STARTUP: overview indent

* Preliminaries (jpeg library)

Install the system libraries used by =phenovisr=.

** Linux/Debian Installation

#+begin_src shell :results output
sudo apt install libjpeg-dev
#+end_src

** Windows Installation (not tested yet)

You'll need the [[http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/jpeg.htm][Jpeg for Windows]] library. To install phenovisr
correctly, the dynamic library must be called =libjpeg.dll= instead of
the =jpeg-62.dll=. You need to make sure your compiler is capable to
find this DLL in your system.

* phenovisr package

Then, you need =devtools= package.

#+begin_src R :results output :session :exports both
install.packages("devtools");
#+end_src

Finally, install =phenovisr= like this:

#+begin_src R :results output :session :exports both
library(devtools);
install_github("schnorr/phenovisr", ref="alles");
#+end_src
