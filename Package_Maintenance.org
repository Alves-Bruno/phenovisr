#+TITLE: Maintenance ORG file for phenovisr package
#+AUTHOR: Lucas Mello Schnorr
#+STARTUP: overview indent
#+TAGS: noexport(n) deprecated(d)
#+EXPORT_SELECT_TAGS: export
#+EXPORT_EXCLUDE_TAGS: noexport

The package has been created with Rcpp's version of =package.skeleton=,
by running the following code. This is no longer necessary because the
package has already been created and modified.

#+begin_src R :results output :session :exports both
library(Rcpp);
Rcpp.package.skeleton("phenovisr");
#+end_src

Every time some new function is exported, we need to recompile the
attributes in the following way, so our R API gets updated.

#+begin_src R :results output :session :exports both
library(Rcpp);
compileAttributes("phenovisr");
#+end_src

The package can be checked and installed the following way (for
development purposes only). Please note that the standard installation
procedure [[./README.org][has already been described in the README file]].

#+begin_src R :results output :session :exports both
R CMD check phenovisr
R CMD INSTALL phenovisr
#+end_src
